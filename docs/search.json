There are two tabs - one contains the senate results, and one contains the governor results. Below is the information I used to import the GA election data.\n\n\nCode\nsenate_results <- read_excel(here(\"ga_votes.xlsx\"), sheet = \"senate\")\n\ngovernor_results <- read_excel(here(\"ga_votes.xlsx\"), sheet = \"governor\")\n\n\nI created a column/bar chart for the Senate race that shows how many counties the Republican candidate did better vs. worse than Trump.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=senate_results, aes(x=factor(is_r_above_trump))) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I did the same as Question 1, just for the race for Governor.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(data=governor_results, aes(x=factor(is_r_above_trump))) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Senate race again, I created a chart that shows the top 10 biggest drops between the Republican candidate and Trump (i.e. the 10 counties with the most substantial negative numbers in pct_r_above_trump). I sliced off a certain number of rows using the head() function.\n\n\nCode\nno3 <- arrange(senate_results, pct_r_above_trump)\ntop10senate <- no3 %>% head(10)\n\nggplot(data=top10senate, aes(x=factor(pct_r_above_trump))) + geom_bar() \n\n\n\n\n\nThen I created a chart that shows the top 10 counties highest margins of victory for the Democratic candidate for Senate. To do that I compared the Democratic candidate’s percentage (pct_d_2022) with the Republican’s (pct_r_2022) to calculate the margin of victory for each county.\n\n\nCode\nsenate_margin <- senate_results %>% mutate(dem_margin = pct_d_2022 - pct_r_2022)\nno4 <- arrange(senate_margin, dem_margin)\ntop10_senate_margin <- no4 %>% head(10)\n\nggplot(data=top10_senate_margin, aes(x=factor(dem_margin))) + geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\nThen I did the same as Q4, only this time for the race for Governor.\n\n\nCode\ngov_margin <- governor_results %>% mutate(dem_margin = pct_d_2022 - pct_r_2022)\nno5 <- arrange(gov_margin, dem_margin)\ntop10_gov_margin <- no5 %>% head(10)\n\nggplot(data=top10_gov_margin, aes(x=factor(dem_margin))) + geom_bar()"
